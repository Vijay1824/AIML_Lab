# AIML_Lab

The programs are used for teaching AIML laboratory. The list of experiments are:
1. Breadth First Search Algorithm
2. Depth First Search Algorithm
3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game using BFS
4. Tic-Tac-Toe Game using DFS
5. Program to create histograms for all numerical features and analyze the distribution of each feature. Generate box plots for all numerical features and identify any outliers. The dataset used is the California Housing Dataset
6. To check if an instance of the 8 puzzle is solvable. Using the theory of inversion. Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-instance-8-puzzle-solvable/
7. ID3 Algorithm for classification using zoo.csv dataset
8. Find-S algorithm for enjoysport.csv dataset
9. Candidate Elimination algorithm for enjoysport.csv, economycar.csv,, shapeaccepted.csv, datasets. Results are not correct for economycar.csv 
10. KNN Classifier for IRIS Dataset
11. LWR Regression using housing dataset
12. Linear Regression
13. Polynomial Regression
14. Naive Bayes Classifier from Scratch NB_scratch.ipynb, also check NB Exercise.pdf in Docs Folder
15. Naive Bayes Classifier using the library
16. RNN Basic example
17. Neural network with different activation functions like sigmoid, ReLu and Tanh
18. RBFNN with two different kernels, viz, Gaussian and Generalized multi-quadric function
